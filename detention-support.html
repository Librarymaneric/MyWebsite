                        <li><b>24/7 Hotline:</b> Call the Chicago/ICIRR hotline (1-855-435-7693)</li>
                        <li><b>Attorney/Legal Aid:</b> Contact your attorney or legal aid. <a href="https://www.icirr.org/_files/ugd/9781a6_a8f0d141bfb14c9ca5a4fb0788a66a14.pdf">Legal Support</a></li>
                        <li><b>Trusted Ally:</b> Identify at least two non-detained adults (friends, family, or neighbors) who know the plan and can be called immediately.

                            <li><b>Financial Access:</b> detail where important documents, keys, spare cash, and bank account information are located.</li>
                            <li><b>A-Number:</b> Clearly write down the Alien Registration Number (A-Number) for every family member who has one.  This is essential for locating a detained person quickly.
                                <ul><li>The A-Number must be provided exactly, including leading zeros (e.g., A012-345-678).</li></ul>

                        In Illinois, Standby Guardianship is a powerful tool allowing parents to designate a temporary guardian for their children without going to court until a specific event occurs, such as detention.
                        <ol>
                        <li><b>What it does:</b> Legally grants temporary physical care and control of your minor child(ren) to a trusted person if you are unable to care for them.</li>
                        <li><b>Required Forms:</b> Families must sign a <a href:"https://gac.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/gac/forms/documents/sbgf.pdf">Designation of Standby Guardian</a> form, which must be witnessed.</li>
                        <li><b>Actionable Advice:</b> The designated guardian should have copies of the child's birth certificate, vaccination records, school information, and health insurance cards.</li>

                <tr><td><h2>Step 3: Complete Power of Attorney</h2><br>
                        A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that gives someone else (your designated agent) the authority to act on your behalf for specific tasks.
                        <ol>
                        <li><b>Properties/Fianances (Durable POA):</b> Allows your agent to access bank accounts, pay bills (mortgage, rent, utilities), and manage your property while you are detained. This ensures your home and finances are protected.</li>
                        <li><b>Healthcare:</b> Allows your agent to make medical decisions for you if you become incapacitated during an encounter or detention.</li>
                        <li><b>Advice:</b> The POA must be signed and notarized to be legally binding. Use these forms:
